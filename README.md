# Detection of Traffic signs using Vanilla Neural Networks

This a project where we classify traffic signs using Vanilla neural networks


This notebook was trained in Google Colab using Tensorflow 2.0 


## Dataset
The dataset here was the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark

You can access the datasets here:
 [GTSRB Dataset](https://sid.erda.dk/public/archives/daaeac0d7ce1152aea9b61d9f1e19370/published-archive.html)

For training dataset, download the file ```GTSRB_Final_Training_Images.zip```

For test dataset, download the file ```GTSRB_Final_Test_Images.zip```
